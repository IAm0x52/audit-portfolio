## <br/> High Risk Findings

### [H-01] Payments for coupons to Booster are irretrievable

#### Details 

[Booster.sol#L92-L99](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/blob/84b6060b4447b2550de595202e8820c7f515988b/contracts/core/Booster.sol#L92-L99)

```solidity
    uint256 price = couponPrice - discount;
    require(token.balanceOf(user) >= price, "Not enough balance");

    token.safeTransferFrom(user, address(this), couponPrice); // @> tokens transferred to this
    userBoostTrades[tokenAddress][user]
        .totalBoostTrades += MAX_TRADES_PER_BOOST;

    emit BuyCoupon(tokenAddress, user, couponPrice);
```

Booster#buy transfers tokens to itself but has no way to recover these tokens, causing them to be permanently trapped in this contract.

#### Lines of Code

[Booster.sol#L80-L100](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/blob/84b6060b4447b2550de595202e8820c7f515988b/contracts/core/Booster.sol#L80-L100)

#### Recommendation

Transfer fees to a configurable address such as admin

#### Remediation

Mitigated [here](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/pull/8) by sending fees to admin rather than the booster contract

### <br/> [H-02] BufferBinaryPool can permanently lock funds on early exercise

#### Details 

[BufferBinaryOptions.sol#L380-L395](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/blob/84b6060b4447b2550de595202e8820c7f515988b/contracts/core/BufferBinaryOptions.sol#L380-L395)

```solidity
    if (option.expiration > closingTime) {
        profit =
            (option.lockedAmount *
                OptionMath.blackScholesPriceBinary(
                    config.iv(),
                    option.strike,
                    closingPrice,
                    option.expiration - closingTime,
                    true,
                    isAbove
                )) /
            1e8;
    } else {
        profit = option.lockedAmount;
    }
    pool.send(optionID, user, profit);
```

When exercising an option early, it is possible to receive a partial payout depending on the factors such as when the contract is unlocked and the current asset price. This will cause the contract to send only a portion of the locked amount.

[BufferBinaryPool.sol#L200-L207](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/blob/84b6060b4447b2550de595202e8820c7f515988b/contracts/core/BufferBinaryPool.sol#L200-L207)

```solidity
    uint256 transferTokenXAmount = tokenXAmount > ll.amount
        ? ll.amount
        : tokenXAmount;

    ll.locked = false;
    lockedPremium = lockedPremium - ll.premium;
    lockedAmount = lockedAmount - transferTokenXAmount;
    tokenX.safeTransfer(to, transferTokenXAmount);
```

This is problematic since the amount of tokens sent is also the amount unlocked. This will leave the remainder of the fees perpetually locked in the BufferBinaryPool contract.

Example:
A user opens an option that locks 100 USDC. After some time they decide to exercise early. Due to current pricing factors their option is exercised for only 50 USDC. This unlocks 50 USDC leaving the other 50 USDC permanently locked, which means they can never be withdrawn by LPs

#### Lines of Code

[BufferBinaryPool.sol#L191-L212](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/blob/84b6060b4447b2550de595202e8820c7f515988b/contracts/core/BufferBinaryPool.sol#L191-L212)

#### Recommendation

BufferBinaryPool#send should always unlock the entire option amount not just the amount sent.

#### Remediation

Mitigated [here](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/pull/7). Upon exercise `option.lockedAmount` is redeemed to the option contract. `profit` is sent to the user and the remainder (if any) is sent back to the pool.

### <br/> [H-03] Market direction signature can be abused if privateKeeperMode is disabled

#### Details 

[BufferRouter.sol#L233-L246](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/blob/84b6060b4447b2550de595202e8820c7f515988b/contracts/core/BufferRouter.sol#L233-L246)

```solidity
    if (
        !Validator.verifyMarketDirection(
            params,
            queuedTrade,
            optionInfo.signer
        )
    ) {
        emit FailUnlock(
            params.optionId,
            params.targetContract,
            "Router: Wrong market direction"
        );
        continue;
    }
```

When options are exercised, the market direction is revealed via a signature provided by the opener. This can cause 2 significant issues if privateKeeperMode is disabled:

1) User can change the direction of their trade after to guarantee they win
2) User can open trade and withhold direction signature to indefinitely lock LP funds

#### Lines of Code

[BufferRouter.sol#L233-L246](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/blob/84b6060b4447b2550de595202e8820c7f515988b/contracts/core/BufferRouter.sol#L233-L246)

[BufferRouter.sol#L300-L313](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/blob/84b6060b4447b2550de595202e8820c7f515988b/contracts/core/BufferRouter.sol#L300-L313)

#### Recommendation

Instead of using a signature at exercise, consider instead concatenating the direction with a salt then hashing storing that hash with the queued trade. Upon closure the salt and direction can be provided and the hash checked against the stored hash.

#### Remediation

Mitigated [here](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/pull/4/) by removing the ability to disable privateKeeperMode

### <br/> [H-04] closeAnytime timestamp is never validated against current timestamp

#### Details 

[BufferRouter.sol#L248-L258](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/blob/84b6060b4447b2550de595202e8820c7f515988b/contracts/core/BufferRouter.sol#L248-L258)

```solidity
    try
        optionsContract.unlock(
            params.optionId,
            params.closingPrice,
            publisherSignInfo.timestamp,
            params.isAbove
        )
    {} catch Error(string memory reason) {
        emit FailUnlock(params.optionId, params.targetContract, reason);
        continue;
    }
```

When exercising early, the timestamp used for unlocking is extremely important. The current implementation doesn't ever validate the current timestamp is anywhere near the current timestamp. If private keeper mode is disabled, a user could exercise their option in the past when they would get a better payoff.

#### Lines of Code

[BufferRouter.sol#L167-L260](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/blob/84b6060b4447b2550de595202e8820c7f515988b/contracts/core/BufferRouter.sol#L167-L260)

#### Recommendation

Validate that exercise timestamp is within some margin of the current timestamp

#### Remediation

Mitigated [here](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/pull/4/) by removing the ability to disable privateKeeperMode. This has only been addressed for non-trusted actors and can still be exploited by a malicious/compromised keeper

### <br/> [H-05] closeAnyTime timestamp is never validated against pricing timestamp

#### Details 

[BufferRouter.sol#L248-L258](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/blob/84b6060b4447b2550de595202e8820c7f515988b/contracts/core/BufferRouter.sol#L248-L258)

```solidity
    try
        optionsContract.unlock(
            params.optionId,
            params.closingPrice,
            publisherSignInfo.timestamp,
            params.isAbove
        )
    {} catch Error(string memory reason) {
        emit FailUnlock(params.optionId, params.targetContract, reason);
        continue;
    }
```

When an option is exercised early, it uses the timestamp of the pricing data without ever checking the timestamp of the closeAnytime signature. This can lead to 2 potential issues:

1) The user may receive less than expected due to the actual exercise timestamp being different than when they signed
2) If private keeper mode is disabled then transactions may be intercepted and the signature used by someone else to close the position with a much different timestamp

#### Lines of Code

[BufferRouter.sol#L167-L260](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/blob/84b6060b4447b2550de595202e8820c7f515988b/contracts/core/BufferRouter.sol#L167-L260)

#### Recommendation

Pricing data timestamp and closeAnytime timestamp should be required to match

#### Remediation

Mitigated [here](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/pull/4/) by removing the ability to disable privateKeeperMode. This has only been addressed for non-trusted actors and can still be exploited by a malicious/compromised keeper

## <br/> Medium Risk Findings

### [M-01] booster#buy fails to apply discount

#### Details 

[Booster.sol#L92-L95](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/blob/84b6060b4447b2550de595202e8820c7f515988b/contracts/core/Booster.sol#L92-L95)

```solidity
    uint256 price = couponPrice - discount;
    require(token.balanceOf(user) >= price, "Not enough balance");

    token.safeTransferFrom(user, address(this), couponPrice); // @> transfers couponPrice rather than price
```

When buying boosts the contract mistakenly transfers couponPrice rather than price which is reduced by discount. Additionally the event also emits this incorrect value.

#### Lines of Code

[Booster.sol#L80-L100](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/blob/84b6060b4447b2550de595202e8820c7f515988b/contracts/core/Booster.sol#L80-L100)

#### Recommendation

Transfer `price` instead of `couponPrice`.

#### Remediation

Mitigated [here](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/pull/8) by sending the discounted price rather than the full coupon price.

### <br/> [M-02] Transferred options can only be closed early by previous owner

#### Details 

[BufferRouter.sol#L197-L205](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/blob/84b6060b4447b2550de595202e8820c7f515988b/contracts/core/BufferRouter.sol#L197-L205)

```solidity
    (address signer, ) = getAccountMapping(queuedTrade.user);

    bool isUserSignValid = Validator.verifyCloseAnytime(
        optionsContract.assetPair(),
        closeParam.userSignInfo.timestamp,
        params.optionId,
        closeParam.userSignInfo.signature,
        signer
    );
```

Options are minted as NFTs allowing options to be transferred to other users. This allows users to potentially sell/transfer their options to other user. This cause 2 issues:

1) The previous owner can close the option early to cause damage to the new owner
2) The new owner cannot close their option early by themselves

#### Lines of Code

[BufferRouter.sol#L167-L260](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/blob/84b6060b4447b2550de595202e8820c7f515988b/contracts/core/BufferRouter.sol#L167-L260)

#### Recommendation

NFT functionality should be removed or closeAnytime should determine the signer based on the owner of the option NFT

#### Remediation

Mitigated [here](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/pull/9/) by only allowing positions to be transferred to/from approved addresses.

## <br/> Low Risk Findings

### [L-01] Users can buy coupons for options that don't exist

#### Details 

Booster#buy allows users to buy boosts for any tokens, which means that user can pay for and buy useless boost for tokens that aren't listed.

#### Lines of Code

[Booster.sol#L80-L100](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/blob/84b6060b4447b2550de595202e8820c7f515988b/contracts/core/Booster.sol#L80-L100)

#### Recommendation

Consider limiting boost purchases to only tokens currently listed for better UX

#### Remediation

Mitigated [here](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/pull/13) the buy function was refactored to be callable only by owner and use permits for approval which negates the impact of this.

### <br/> [L-02] registerAccount sub-call in BufferRouter#openTrades can revert entire transaction

#### Details 

[BufferRouter.sol#L144-L150](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/blob/84b6060b4447b2550de595202e8820c7f515988b/contracts/core/BufferRouter.sol#L144-L150)

```solidity
    if (params[index].register.shouldRegister) {
        accountRegistrar.registerAccount(
            params[index].register.oneCT,
            user,
            params[index].register.signature
        );
    }
```

The openTrades function has been designed to prevent it from reverting under almost every circumstance. The exception to this is that accountRegistrar.registerAccount can revert the entire transaction.

#### Lines of Code

[BufferRouter.sol#L107-L165](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/blob/84b6060b4447b2550de595202e8820c7f515988b/contracts/core/BufferRouter.sol#L107-L165)

#### Recommendation

Consider using a try-catch block to prevent it from reverting

#### Remediation

Mitigated [here](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/pull/12) by implementing a try-catch block

## <br/> Informational Findings

### [I-01] Booster#buy should support buying multiple boosts at a time

#### Details 

Booster#buy only allows the purchase of one boost at a time. Consider allowing users to bulk buy boosts to save transactions and gas.

#### Lines of Code

[Booster.sol#L80-L100](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/blob/84b6060b4447b2550de595202e8820c7f515988b/contracts/core/Booster.sol#L80-L100)

#### Recommendation

Consider allowing multiple boosts to be purchased in a single transaction

#### Remediation

Mitigated [here](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/pull/11) by allowing the user to buy multiple coupons in a single transaction

### <br/> [I-02] OptionMath#_decay is never used

#### Details 

OptionMath#_decay is never used and should be removed

#### Lines of Code

[OptionMath.sol#L24-L32](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/blob/84b6060b4447b2550de595202e8820c7f515988b/contracts/core/OptionMath.sol#L24-L32)

#### Recommendation

OptionMath#_decay should be removed

#### Remediation

Mitigated [here](https://github.com/Buffer-Finance/Buffer-Protocol-v2_5/pull/10) by removing OptionMath#_decay
